For this I used WSL since Windows had some problems with using C and Python together in VScode, remember to also install VcXsrv (for showing plots)

(Use this in case you dont see .venv folder) Once you have your WSL running, position yourself in DD2358-project/cython, and then use: python3 -m venv cython_env (this creates virtual environment where you have to install all dependencies)

You then activate it by running: source cython_env/bin/activate

Inside venv use:

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install cython numpy matplotlib scipy

In the directory, you will notice setup.py, this is a script for compiling our optimized_funcs.c script with functions written in C 
You compile it using: python setup.py build_ext --inplace (it should create .so file)

Also install: sudo apt install python3-tk (this is later used for plotting)

Run: export DISPLAY=:0 (make sure your VcXsrv is running, you can check that by running xclock)

And finally, run: python cython_sph.py
